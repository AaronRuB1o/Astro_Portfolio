Our school thesis which we have to make a Plate recognition system specialized in the philippine's license plate format text. We used Tensorflow or specifically Keras, in order to create the model we will use the base to detect the license plates. We used EasyOCR to train the text model to specifically detect the font used on the License plate within the Philippines to read the contents within the License Plate. We deployed it using Yolov4 where it could be used as a live camera, picture or recording.
